# 🌱 ʻĀina Bucks
A simple, community-driven system to track contributions, reward participation, and seed long-term ownership in the KILO / ʻĀina Bucks ecosystem.

This tool lets members view balances, redeem rewards, and understand their role in building a regenerative, community-owned future.

## ✨ Core Goals

- Honor contributions of time, skill, and aloha ʻāina.
- Create a reciprocal economy where value flows back to the community.
- Keep the system simple, tangible, and fun in early stages.
- Provide a path from short-term rewards (credits/bucks) to long-term ownership (shares/equity).

## 🔑 Brainstorming Terms
### 💧 ʻAuwai Credits (Community Currency)
- Day-to-day currency of participation.
- Earned by volunteering, attending events, helping other teams, or contributing feedback.
- Redeemable for goods, services, and experiences (coffee, coworking, workshops, etc.).

Think of ʻAuwai as the **daily water flow** — always moving and circulating.

### 🌍 ʻĀina Bucks (Volunteer Value Exchange)
- Points that recognize labor on the ʻāina.
- Measured by hours of service and type of labor (skilled, general, cultural, etc.).
- Tracks the social, cultural, and ecological impact of stewardship.

### 🌊 Wai Shares (Long-Term Equity)

- Ownership/gov tokens of the a tech ecosystem.
- Awarded for major contributions (leading a project, building core tech, organizing events).
- Not meant to be spent, but held as a stake in the future.

Think of Wai as the **deep aquifer** — it grows as the community invests in itself.

## 📜 Guiding Principles
- Circulation, not extraction – Value should keep flowing in the network.
- Reciprocity – Everyone (volunteers, businesses, nonprofits) both earns and spends.
- Scaffolded growth – Start simple (points, punch cards), scale up (wallets, DAO).
- Aloha ʻĀina First – Currency exists only because of and for the ʻāina.

 Pilot at hackathons & ʻāina workdays.

 Expand to co-op + DAO hybrid governance model.
